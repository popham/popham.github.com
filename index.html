    <p>Welcome to my (embarassingly) new Github projects page. For now there's only the one project.</p>
    
    <p><a href="/chatterbox/chatterbox.xhtml">Chatterbox</a> is a toy project intended to test the feasibility of WebSockets across mobile platforms (Android and iPhone) and modern browsers, with a server built in Ruby. I expect the project to look decent before March of 2012. If all goes well, my new wisdom will get folded into a commercial project. As the code gets integrated into a larger ecosystem, I expect namespacing revisions to propagate into this codebase to facilitate such integration for others and myself in the future. Any architectural changes, however, will probably remain in a private fork.</p>
